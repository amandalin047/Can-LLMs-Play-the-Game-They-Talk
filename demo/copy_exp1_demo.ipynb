      "LLM:  ['Gaussian curvature is a measure of the intrinsic curvature of a surface at a given point. It is an important concept in differential geometry and is used to understand the shape of a surface independently of how it is embedded in space.\\n\\nHere’s how you can calculate Gaussian curvature:\\n\\n1. **Definition**: At a point on a surface, Gaussian curvature (\\\\(K\\\\)) is defined as the product of the principal curvatures (\\\\(k_1\\\\) and \\\\(k_2\\\\)), which are the maximum and minimum curvatures at that point:\\n   \\\\[\\n   K = k_1 \\\\cdot k_2\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Principal Curvatures**: These curvatures can be determined by considering the normal curvature of curves on the surface. For a surface given by a smooth parametric function, the principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator.\\n\\n3. **Calculating in Local Coordinates**: If the surface is given in local coordinates as \\\\(z = f(x, y)\\\\), Gaussian curvature can be calculated using the first and second fundamental forms:\\n   - The first fundamental form is given by:\\n     \\\\[\\n     E = 1 + f_x^2, \\\\quad F = f_x f_y, \\\\quad G = 1 + f_y^2\\n     \\\\]\\n   - The second fundamental form is:\\n     \\\\[\\n     L = f_{xx}, \\\\quad M = f_{xy}, \\\\quad N = f_{yy}\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n   The Gaussian curvature is then:\\n   \\\\[\\n   K = \\\\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n4. **For Parametric Surfaces**: If a surface is given parametrically as \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}(u, v)\\\\), where \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\) is a vector function in terms of parameters \\\\(u\\\\) and \\\\(v\\\\), Gaussian curvature can be derived using derivatives of \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}\\\\):\\n\\n   - Compute the partial derivatives \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}_u\\\\) and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}_v\\\\).\\n   - The first fundamental form coefficients are:\\n     \\\\[\\n     E = \\\\mathbf{r}_u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_u, \\\\quad F = \\\\mathbf{r}_u \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_v, \\\\quad G = \\\\mathbf{r}_v \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_v\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Compute the second partial derivatives \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}_{uu}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}_{uv}\\\\), and \\\\(\\\\mathbf{r}_{vv}\\\\).\\n   - The second fundamental form coefficients can be obtained via the normal vector \\\\(\\\\mathbf{N}\\\\):\\n     \\\\[\\n     L = \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_{uu}, \\\\quad M = \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_{uv}, \\\\quad N = \\\\mathbf{N} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{r}_{vv}\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n   Then, the Gaussian curvature is:\\n   \\\\[\\n   K = \\\\frac{LN - M^2}{EG - F^2}\\n   \\\\]\\n\\nGaussian curvature provides deep geometric insights.
